Budvisory-AI is an AI travel budget advisor designed to help people plan realistic domestic trips in Indonesia. It turns budget constraints into actionable, day-by-day itineraries with practical cost guidance.

## The Problem
Travel planning is often stressful and uncertain, especially when budgets are tight:

- Travel content is generic and rarely reflects real Indonesian prices.
- Budget uncertainty creates stress and overthinking.
- Travelers don’t know if their plans are financially feasible.

## Target Audience
Budvisory-AI is built for:

- Young professionals
- Students
- Budget-conscious travelers

They want inspiration that is financially sound and actionable.

## The Solution
Budvisory-AI is budget-first and Indonesia-focused. Users provide:

- Origin city
- Destination
- Trip duration
- Total budget

In seconds, the system generates:

- Day-by-day itinerary
- Estimated costs and savings buffer
- Packing list
- Safety notes

## How It Works
1. Select origin city (or use current location).
2. Choose destination.
3. Input trip duration and total budget.
4. (Optional) Enable Dream Destination mode.
5. Add preferences like local food or specific places.
6. Generate recommendations with one click.

Budvisory-AI returns itinerary recommendations tailored to real budget conditions instead of generic suggestions.

## Demo Output Example
A 3-day trip from Yogyakarta to Jakarta with a 7,000,000 IDR budget can produce:

- Daily budget: Rp 1,500,000
- Total estimated cost: Rp 4,500,000
- Savings buffer: Rp 2,500,000

Alongside the numbers, users get advisory tips, recommended transport options, and a packing list.

## Unique Value Proposition
Unlike destination-centric travel tools, Budvisory-AI is budget-centric. It blends local travel context with financial practicality—like having a travel planner and a financial advisor combined.

## Why Now?
